## Cheatsheet 􀥅
### General
 - **Set theory:** the branch of mathematics that studies sets.
 - **Set:** a collection of non-repeatable objects. (not to be confused with **Seth**, a very nice robot creature that will help you in your journey)
 - **Enumeration:** a method of defining a set by enumerating its elements.
 - **Subset:** a set whose elements are all contained in another set.
 - **Empty set:** a set with no elements, which can be also represented by the symbol Ø.
 
 ### Diagrams
 - **Venn diagram:** one of the ways to graphically represent math sets.
 - **Intersection 􀫲:** the diagram formed by two overlapping sets A and B that share common elements. Its middle can be represented by **A ∩ B**.
 - **Containment 􀍷:** the diagram of two contained sets A and B where all elements of one belong to the other. This relationship can be defined by **A ⊂ B** or **B ⊂ A**, depending on which set is a subset of which.
 - **Three-way diagram 􀟗:** a diagram containing three sets A, B and C that all share a same subset of elements. Its center can be expressed by **A ∩ B ∩ C**.
